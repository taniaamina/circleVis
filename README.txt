# Music visualisation through p5.js
#
# Upload a song of your choice and enjoy it's characteristics visualised in 
# this webapp that is built with a little help from p5.js and randomColor.js. 
# 
# The amplitude of the song is represented by a square, the amplitude at 
# different frequencies by "lightning" across the screen and the beat by 
# a circle. 
# 
# In the current version of the app, the colors and stars across the screen
# are just there for the aesthetics. The colors of them are randomly chosen 
# and will change with every new upload.
